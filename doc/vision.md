üß¨ Long-Term Goals
Compiled pipelines (data loading ‚Üí inference)

Auto graph partitioning for multi-device

DSL for defining new layers and ops

Graph diffing for debugging and optimization

Smart kernel fusion and graph simplification

Optional: distributed runtime with checkpointing

‚ù§Ô∏è Why DLVM is Worth Building
You build it once, you can:

Run models anywhere

Analyze them deeply

Transform them automatically

Replace any part without breaking others

DLVM can become:

A research tool

A framework backend

A training compiler

A deployment engine

Even a programming language for AI
